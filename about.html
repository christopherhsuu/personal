            <h2>About Christopher</h2>
            <p>To whoever is reading this: Thank you for being here.
                I'm Christopher, a baseball nerd and steak enthusiast. 
                I was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan, and have played baseball throughout my entire life.
                As I grew older, I realized that although I loved playing the sport, I saw myself more drawn to the analytical side it.
                Growing up, I asked questions about everything, so it was natrual that I would be curious about the sport that I surrounded myself with at all times of the day.</p>
            <p>It was in 2017, during Aaron Judge's historic rookie home run race, when I truly began falling in love with the numbers behind the game. 
                I was fascinated by the advanced statistics that were being used to evaluate players and teams. 
                I spent countless hours reading articles, watching videos, and listening to podcasts about sabermetrics and baseball analytics. 
                Specifically, Foolish Baseball's video on Pedro Martinez's run of dominance from 1998 to 2000 that opened my eyes to sabermetrics.</p>
            <p>My goal with this blog is to share my passion for baseball analytics with others, and give back to the community that has taught me so much. 
                I hope to provide valuable insights, analysis, and commentary on the latest trends and developments in the world of sabermetrics. 
                I also hope to connect with other baseball fans and sabermetricians, and learn from their experiences and perspectives.</p>
